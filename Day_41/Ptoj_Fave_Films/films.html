<br>
<h3>Blazing Saddles</h3>
<p>Teenage boy humour, but who cares it's funny</p>
<br>
<h3>Airplane</h3>
<p>Very funny film with some of my favourite actors</p>
<br>
<h3>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</h3>
<p>Great film.  So trashy who wouldn't like it?</p>
<br>
<h3>Anything by the Monty Python Team</h3>
<p>Great humour, mostly not for kids</p>
